# Mobile App Assets

This folder should contain your app icons and splash screens for Expo.

## Required Files

Create these placeholder images (or use your own designs):

### 1. `icon.png`
- Size: 1024x1024 px
- App icon for iOS and Android
- Simple logo or initials

### 2. `adaptive-icon.png`
- Size: 1024x1024 px
- Android adaptive icon foreground

### 3. `splash.png`
- Size: 1284x2778 px (iPhone 13 Pro Max size)
- Splash screen / loading screen

### 4. `notification-icon.png`

- Push notification icon (Android)

### 5. `favicon.png`
- Size: 48x48 px

## Quick Setup with Placeholders

For now, you can create simple colored squares as placeholders:

1. Go to [placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/)
2. Generate the required sizes
3. Download and save to this folder

Or use this online tool to generate app icons:
- [makeappicon.com](https://makeappicon.com/)

## When to Update

Replace these placeholders with your real branding before:
- Submitting to App Store / Play Store
- Sharing with beta testers
- Production launch

**Note:** The app will work fine without these for local development. Expo will show warnings but still run.
